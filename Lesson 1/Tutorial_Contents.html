  <!-- You can put images in HTML files as well! For that, <img> element is needed.
       The <img> element does NOT need a closing tag.
    -->
  <!-- The <img> element takes in 2 attributes:
       src - The path to the image.
       alt - An alternate text for the image, if the image can't be displayed.
    -->
  <!-- **IMPORTANT: It's always better to specify the length and the width of the image,
       else the page might flicker while the image loads.**
    -->
  <!-- NOTE: For the sake of simplicity, put the image in the same directory/folder as your HTML file.
       This way, the path to the image is just the name of the said image.
    -->
  <img src="Frieren.jpeg" alt="Anime Elf" width="922" height="420">


  <!-- You can also insert hyperlinks. To do so, the <a> element is needed. -->
  <!-- The <a> element takes in 1 attribute:
       href - the link's destination.
    -->
  <!-- IMPORTANT: If the <a> tag does not have a "href" attribute, it's only a placeholder for a hyperlink -->
