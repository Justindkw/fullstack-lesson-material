<!-- In this Tutorial, you will be learning how to add interactions between a user and the website. -->
<!-- You will also learn how to incorporate Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to add more styles :) -->

  <!-- A basic form of interactivity is a button that a user can click.
       To do that, you will need a "<button> element.
    -->
  <!-- NOTE: There are three types of buttons: button, reset, and submit.
       The "reset" and "submit" buttons are usually used in a <form> element.
       Therefore, use the "button" as the default type.
    -->
  <!-- **IMPORTANT: Always specify what type of button you are using in the "type" attribute.
       This signals the browser what type of button it is.** -->
  <button type="button" class="button" id="button1">Click me!</button>
  <button type="button" class="button" id="button2">No Click me! Please Please Please Please Please Please</button>
  <!-- Notice that this button looks plain. We will be styling it using CSS. -->


  <!-- You can use a <form> element to collect user inputs.
       This is very common in FullStack applications since the use inputs will be sent to the Back-end for processing.
    -->
  <form>

    <!-- Use the <label> element to add a description. This way the user knows what input would be required. -->
    <!-- NOTE: Use the tag <br> for a line break. Except for the very last line of the form. -->
    <!-- **IMPORTANT: <label> element has a "for" attribute.
         This must be equal to the "id" attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.
         The <input> element will be explained shortly.
      -->
    <label for="fname">Enter your first name:</label><br>

    <!-- To allow the user to input data into the web page, you can use the <input> element. -->
    <!-- The <input> element must have 3 attributes:
         type - How the element will be displayed.
         id - The identifier of the input.
         name - The name of the input element.
      -->
    <!-- **IMPORTANT: The "id" must be equal the "for" attribute in the <label> element.** -->
    <!-- **IMPORTANT: The value of the input field will NOT be sent if the "name attribute is omitted. -->
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>

    <label for="lname">Enter your lirst name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
    <!-- In the example above, 'type="text"' defines a single-line field for text input.
         This text input can be submitted to the Back-end for processing.
      -->
