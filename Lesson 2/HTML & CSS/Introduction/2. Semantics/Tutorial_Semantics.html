<!-- Welcome to the tutorial for the Basics of HTML!-->
<!-- In this Tutorial, you will be learning some of the HTML semantics, -->
<!-- These will make your web page more organized :) -->

<!-- Just like a regular document, you can also add header and footer elements. -->
<!-- You can put introductory information inside the header, like header elements, logo, and authorship. -->
<!-- NOTE: You can MORE THAN ONE header elements in one HTML document.
     However, you can't place a <header> inside a <footer> or another <header>.
-->
<header>

  <!-- Header elements range from <h1> to <h6>. The smaller the number is, the larger the heading becomes. -->
  <!-- This means that <h1> has the biggest heading font, and <h6> has the smallest heading font. -->
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>

</header>


<body>

  <!-- The paragraph element (denoted as <p>) is used to organize paragraphs. -->
  <!-- A paragraph always starts on a new line,
       and the browser automatically add a margin before & after a paragraph.
    -->
  <p>
      I remembered you was conflicted.
      Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same.
      Abusing my power full of resentment.
      Resentment that turned into a deep depression.
      Found myself screamin' in the hotel room.
      I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me.
      So I went runnin' for answers.
  </p>

  <p>
      So I was                   talking a                                                walk
      the            other       day.
  </p>
  <!-- NOTE: The browser automatically remove any extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code. -->

  <!-- A <div> element is classified as a block.
       By default, it takes up all the available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.
    -->
  <div>
      <h3>New ideas starts from here.</h3>
      <p>What's up? How is it going? Did something good happen?</p>
  </div>

  <!-- A <span> element is used to mark up a part of a text or a part of document. -->
  <!-- We can use this to make a part of a text appearing different from the others.
       a style attribute with a color keyword should do the trick here.
    -->
  <p>This is very <span style="color:orangered">interesting</span>, isn't it?</p>
  <!-- NOTE: <span> element is very similar to <div>, but <span> is an inline element while <div> is a block element.
       This means that a <span> element only takes up as much width as necessary and does not start a new line. -->

  <!-- You can also list items in HTML! This can be achieved using the <ul> element or the <ol> element. -->
  <!-- If you want to create a BULLET list, use the <ul> element.
       If you want to create a NUMBERED list, use the <ol> element.-->
  <!-- **IMPORTANT: Must use the <li> element for each item in the list.** -->
  <p>Today's TODO list:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Wake up</li>
      <li>Eat breakfast</li>
      <li>Go to work</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Steps to cook rice:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Get some rice in a cooking bowl</li>
    <li>Wash the rice at least twice</li>
    <li>Put in an appropriate amount of water and cook in rice cooker</li>
  </ol>
