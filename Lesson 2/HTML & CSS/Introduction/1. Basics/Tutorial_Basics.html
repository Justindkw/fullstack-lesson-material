<!-- Welcome to the tutorial for the 1. Basics of HTML!-->
<!-- In this Tutorial, you will be learning the Basic structures of HTML :) -->


<!-- The "!DOCTYPE" below is a declaration, it tells the web browser how the web page should be rendered. -->
<!-- **IMPORTANT: This can only appear ONCE, on top of the page.** -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- To start a html file, you need to open with the "<html>" tag. -->
<html lang="en">

<!--
Sometimes you can put attributes in a tag.
In this case, "lang" is an attribute and the keyword "en" is used to declare that the Web page is written in English.
 -->

<!--
NOTE: At the end of the file, you need to close with the </html> tag.
The two tags creates a space in between them where you can write extra content.
Together, the three components (start tag, contents, end tag) creates an "ELEMENT".
-->

<!-- The "head" element is placed between the "html" and the "body" element. -->
<!-- It is often used to provide information about other data. 3. Contents written here will not be displayed.-->
<head>

  <!-- The meta element defines data that will be interpreted by the browser.-->
  <!-- In this case, it defines the character set used in the document. -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

  <!-- The Title element states the title of the document. It's shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.-->
  <!-- **IMPORTANT: The title must be text-only.** -->

  <title>HTML basics</title>

  <!-- Feel free to play around with the text, see what happens! -->

  <!-- You can use a <link> element to display icons.
       The "rel" attribute is REQUIRED to specify the relationship between this document and the linked document.
    -->
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Lesson%202/HTML%20&%20CSS/Introduction/1.%20Basics/favicon.ico">

  <!-- You can directly use style elements in HTML as well. You can use the <style> element for that to happen.
       **IMPORTANT: The <style> element MUST be put inside the <head> element.**
       (This is because that <style> tells the browser how HTML elements should be rendered.
    -->
  <!-- Since the style also ties in with the CSS, we will cover what you can put inside the element later. -->
  <style>

  </style>

</head>

<!-- It is also possible to embed JavaScript directly inside the HTML file.
     This can be achieved with the <script> element.
  -->
<!-- Since this is an introduction to HTML, we won't be doing any JavaScript here. -->
<script>

</script>

<!-- The contents within the body element are displayed on the webpage. -->
<body>

  Hello world!

  <!-- You can replace the message above with anything you want to write, give it a go! -->
</body>

<!-- Close the html file by using "<\html>", nothing should appear after it. -->
</html>
